# Onboarding / Feature Tutorial

**Phase:** 2 | **Version:** 0.15 | **Status:** Complete

## Problem

New users land on the app with no guidance on how TaskGlitch works. The core concept — creating tasks, then "glitching" them into a schedule — is unique and not immediately obvious. A `GlitchExplained` component exists but it's only shown on the schedule page when no schedule is active.

## Requirements

### Core

- [x] Create a first-time user onboarding flow that introduces the key concepts:
  1. Add tasks to your backlog with priority, size, and optional deadline
  2. TaskGlitch auto-prioritises your tasks using a scoring algorithm
  3. Hit "Glitch It" to generate an optimised schedule for your work session
  4. Work through your schedule, complete tasks, and track your progress
- [x] Onboarding should be skippable at any point
- [x] Onboarding should be re-accessible from a help menu or settings
- [x] Track whether onboarding has been completed in the user's account settings

### Approach Options

- **Option A: Guided tour** — Step-by-step tooltips that highlight each part of the UI as the user navigates. Works well for visual learning but requires a library (e.g., Shepherd.js, vue-tour).
- **Option B: Welcome modal sequence** — A series of illustrated modal screens (like app store screenshots). Simpler to implement, but less contextual.
- **Option C: Interactive walkthrough** — Guide the user through creating their first task and generating their first schedule with real actions. Most engaging but most complex to build.

- [x] Decide on approach (recommendation: Option B for v0.14, with Option A/C as a future enhancement)

### Content

- [x] Write onboarding copy that explains TaskGlitch's value proposition in simple terms
- [x] Include visual examples or illustrations for each step
- [x] Keep it brief — 3-5 screens maximum

## Files Likely Affected

- `src/stores/app.js` — onboarding completion flag in account settings
- `src/components/GlitchExplained.vue` — may be refactored/replaced
- New component: `src/components/OnboardingModal.vue`
- `src/App.vue` — trigger onboarding for new users

## Acceptance Criteria

1. New users see onboarding on their first login
2. Onboarding explains the core workflow clearly
3. Users can skip onboarding at any point
4. Users can re-access onboarding from settings/help
5. Onboarding state persists across sessions
