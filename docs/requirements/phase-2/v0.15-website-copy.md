# Write Website Copy

**Phase:** 2 | **Version:** 0.15 | **Status:** Not Started

## Problem

The app has no marketing or explanatory copy. There's no landing page for logged-out users, no feature descriptions, and no clear value proposition communicated to potential users.

## Requirements

### Core

- [ ] Write a landing page for logged-out visitors that explains what TaskGlitch does
- [ ] Define the value proposition: what makes TaskGlitch different from other task managers?
- [ ] Write feature descriptions for the main capabilities:
  - Intelligent task prioritisation
  - Schedule generation ("Glitch It")
  - Break scheduling
  - Dashboard & analytics
- [ ] Include a clear call-to-action (sign up / get started)

### Content Sections

- [ ] Hero section: tagline + one-sentence description
- [ ] How it works: 3-4 step visual explanation
- [ ] Features: brief descriptions of key capabilities
- [ ] CTA: sign up prompt

### Tone

- Modern, slightly playful (fits the "Glitch" branding)
- Productivity-focused but not corporate
- Concise — respect the user's time (very on-brand for a task manager)

### Technical

- [ ] Create a landing page view for unauthenticated users (or repurpose the login page)
- [ ] Ensure copy is accessible and readable
- [ ] Consider SEO basics: meta description, Open Graph tags

## Files Likely Affected

- `src/views/LoginView.vue` — may become a landing page with login embedded
- New view: `src/views/LandingView.vue` (if separate from login)
- `index.html` — meta tags, Open Graph
- `src/router/index.js` — routing for landing page

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Logged-out users see a landing page that explains TaskGlitch
2. The value proposition is clear within 5 seconds of landing
3. There is a clear path to sign up
4. Copy is consistent with the app's tone and branding
