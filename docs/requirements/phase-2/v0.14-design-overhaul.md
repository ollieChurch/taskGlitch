# Design Overhaul

**Phase:** 2 | **Version:** 0.14 | **Status:** Complete

## Problem

The current UI is functional but visually basic and boring. The app lacks visual personality, polish, and the kind of design quality that makes users want to keep using it. Navigation transitions are minimal — on lower-powered devices, switching between pages feels unresponsive because there is no visual feedback beyond a simple fade.

## Requirements

### Visual Identity

- [x] Define a cohesive colour palette beyond the current default Tailwind greys and blues
- [x] Establish consistent spacing, border-radius, and shadow conventions
- [x] Better use of the Rajdhani and Wallpoet fonts to create a distinctive look
- [x] Design a visual style that reflects the "glitch" brand identity

### Page Layout & Structure

- [x] Improve the ContentCard wrapper — consider richer card designs with headers, borders, or accents
- [x] Improve visual hierarchy across all views (headings, sections, whitespace)
- [x] Add visual separation between sections (Dashboard stats, charts, actions)

### Navigation & Transitions

- [x] Improve route transition beyond the current basic fade (e.g. directional slide, content stagger)
- [x] Add micro-interactions to nav links (active states, hover effects)
- [x] Ensure transitions feel responsive even on CPU-throttled / low-tier mobile devices

### Component Polish

- [x] Redesign TaskCard — make it more visually engaging with better use of colour, icons, and layout
- [x] Improve button styles — consistent sizing, hover/active states, better visual weight
- [x] Improve form inputs in modals (TaskModal, ScheduleSetUpModal, SettingsModal)
- [x] Add subtle animations where appropriate (task completion, schedule generation)

### Dashboard

- [x] Improve chart presentation (card wrappers, labels, empty states)
- [x] Make the "Glitch it" and "Add task" buttons more visually prominent as primary actions
- [x] Better layout for stats widgets (FilterWidget)

### Responsive Design

- [x] Review and improve mobile layout across all views
- [x] Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44px)
- [x] Test and polish the mobile hamburger menu experience

### Additional (emerged during implementation)

- [x] Full dark sci-fi theme with CSS custom properties as design tokens
- [x] Angular/clipped corners via CSS `clip-path` polygons
- [x] Migrated from Font Awesome to Lucide icons (MIT, Vue ecosystem)
- [x] Toggleable Cyberpunk Mode (neon glow, scan lines, glitch effects) in Profile settings
- [x] Priority-low colour changed from cyan to violet to avoid UI accent clash
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` support for cyberpunk animations

## Files Likely Affected

- `src/assets/main.css` — global styles, colour variables, utility classes
- `src/App.vue` — route transitions
- `src/components/ContentCard.vue` — page layout wrapper
- `src/components/HeaderNav.vue` — navigation styling
- `src/components/TaskCard.vue` — task display
- `src/components/IconButton.vue` — button styling
- `src/components/FilterWidget.vue` — stats display
- `src/components/ui/BaseModal.vue` — modal styling
- `src/views/DashboardView.vue` — dashboard layout
- `src/views/TaskView.vue` — task list layout
- `src/views/ScheduleView.vue` — schedule layout
- `tailwind.config.js` — custom theme tokens

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The app has a distinctive, cohesive visual identity that reflects the TaskGlitch brand
2. Navigation between pages provides clear visual feedback on all devices, including low-tier mobile
3. All interactive elements have visible hover, focus, and active states
4. The design feels polished and intentional rather than default/generic
5. Mobile experience is smooth with appropriately sized touch targets
