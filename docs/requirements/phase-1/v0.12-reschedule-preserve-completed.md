# Improve Reschedule to Preserve Completed Tasks

**Phase:** 1 | **Version:** 0.12 | **Status:** Complete

## Problem

When the user clicks "Reschedule", the current behaviour rebuilds the schedule from scratch with only the remaining tasks. Any tasks the user has already completed disappear from the schedule entirely. This feels unrewarding — the user loses their visible progress and the sense of momentum from seeing what they've accomplished during the session.

## Requirements

### Core

- [x] When rescheduling, keep completed tasks in the schedule rather than discarding them
- [x] Completed tasks should appear at the top of the schedule, in the order they were completed
- [x] Completed tasks should retain their crossed-off / ticked-off visual state
- [x] Remaining (non-completed) tasks are rescheduled from the current time onwards, below the completed section
- [x] System breaks that occurred before the reschedule point should be removed (they're in the past)
- [x] New system breaks should be inserted into the remaining tasks as normal

### Display

- [x] Clear visual separation between the "completed" section and the "remaining" section of the schedule
- [x] Completed tasks should not have editable time slots (their times are in the past)
- [x] Remaining tasks should show updated time slots starting from now

### Edge Cases

- [x] If all tasks are already completed, rescheduling should have no effect (or show the finish state if implemented)
- [x] If no tasks are completed, rescheduling behaves as it does today (rebuild from current time)
- [x] Completed system breaks should be excluded from the completed section (they are not rewarding to see)

## Files Affected

- `src/views/ScheduleView.vue` — reschedule method rewritten to preserve completed tasks
- `src/components/TaskSchedule.vue` — divider between completed/remaining, edit mode split (completed static, remaining draggable)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ~~After rescheduling, previously completed tasks remain visible at the top of the schedule in completion order~~ Done
2. ~~Remaining tasks are rescheduled from the current time with fresh time slots and breaks~~ Done
3. ~~The schedule clearly distinguishes between the completed and remaining sections~~ Done
4. ~~Rescheduling with no completed tasks behaves the same as before~~ Done
